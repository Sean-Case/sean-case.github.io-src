I like dabbling in statistics, politics, and data science, which is why I made this site. As well as the vote analysis projects on this website, I have working with Bellingcat on open source investigation projects concerning Ukraine and Russia such as [this one](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2016/12/21/russian-artillery-strikes-against-ukraine/) and [this one](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2015/02/17/origin-of-artillery-attacks/).
